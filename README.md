# Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm
This repository contains Python code that implements the Round Robin scheduling algorithm. The code includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter to input the number of processes and their details, and visualize the scheduling process.

## Features
### Round Robin Scheduling:
- The code implements the Round Robin scheduling algorithm, which is a pre-emptive CPU scheduling algorithm. It allows each process to run for a fixed time slice before moving to the next process.

### Graphical User Interface:
- The GUI built with Tkinter provides an interactive interface for users to input the number of processes and their arrival time and burst time. It also displays the execution order and the calculated completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time for each process.

### Customizable Time Slice: 
- The time slice for the Round Robin algorithm can be customized based on user input.

## Usage
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Install the required packages by running the command pip install prettytable tkinter.
- Clone the repository or download the source code files.
- Run the Python script to start the GUI.
- Enter the number of processes in the input field.
- Enter the arrival time and burst time for each process in the respective fields.
- Enter the desired time slice.
- Click the "Apply Algorithm" button to execute the Round Robin scheduling algorithm.
- The GUI will display the process details and the execution order.
- The calculated completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time for each process will be shown.
- Adjust the time slice or input new process details to observe the impact on the scheduling algorithm.
- Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and adapt it to your specific requirements.
